/**
 * Paths that read as documentation but are build inputs, so changing one must run the suite.
 * Most Markdown in this repository is executable prompt or skill content rather than prose, and
 * the checks that guard it all live inside the job this decision can skip — so a bare `.md` test
 * would let a bundled-prompt edit skip the very check built to catch that drift.
 *
 * An entry ending in `/` matches a directory, anything else matches one file. Each is here
 * because a named check reads it:
 *   - `.archon/commands/`, `.archon/workflows/` are compiled into
 *     `packages/workflows/src/defaults/bundled-defaults.generated.ts` (`check:bundled`).
 *   - `.claude/skills/` is imported as text by `packages/cli/src/bundled-skill.ts`, so it is
 *     compiled into the CLI itself (`check:bundled-skill`).
 *   - `provider-capabilities.md` is generated from the providers' `capabilities.ts`
 *     (`check:capability-matrix`), and lives under the docs site without being prose.
 *   - The docs manifest is copied by the Docker dependency layer.

/**
 * Files this change introduces, via a MERGE-BASE (three-dot) diff.
 *
 * Two-dot `git diff A B` reports every difference between the commits, so on a `pull_request`
 * it also reports commits that landed on the base branch after the branch point and attributes
 * them to the PR. One stray `.ts` path is enough to force the suite, which silently disabled
 * this filter for any PR opened against a moving branch. Three-dot compares against the merge
 * base, so it reports only what the branch itself changed.
 *
 * Correct for `push` too: `before` is an ancestor of `after`, so it is its own merge base and
 * the two forms agree. Exported so a test can exercise the diff mode rather than only the
 * pure decision below — a correct decision behind a wrong diff is exactly what shipped here.
 *
 * `repo` defaults to the process working directory, which is what the workflow runs in. It is a
 * parameter because this function's answer depends entirely on which repository it reads.
