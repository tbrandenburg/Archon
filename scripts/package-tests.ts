/**
 * Runs one package's tests, from that package's directory.
 *
 * A package splits its suite into groups that each get a fresh `bun test` process,
 * because mocks leak between files inside a single process. Expressing those groups
 * as `bun test ... && bun test ...` directly in the `test` script has a trap: `bun run`
 * appends its arguments to whatever the script expands to, so `bun run test <path>`
 * runs the whole chain and then tacks the path onto the last group. Going through this
 * runner makes the argument mean what it says.
 *
 * Groups live in the package's own `package.json` under `testGroups`, which is also
 * where `scripts/test-inventory.test.ts` reads them to prove every test file is run.
