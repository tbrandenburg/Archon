 * Runs the repository's tests, from the repository root.
 *
 * With no arguments it walks `ROOT_TEST_PLAN`, which is the work the
 * `bun --filter '*' --parallel test && bun test ./scripts/ && bun test ./.archon/scripts/`
 * chain used to do. The chain had to go because `bun run` appends its arguments to
 * whatever the script expands to, so `bun run test <path>` ran the whole chain and then
 * tacked the path onto its last step — green even when the path was wrong.
 *
 * With arguments, an argument that names a path inside a workspace package or inside a
 * root-owned test directory decides where `bun test` runs; every other argument (flags,
 * substring filters, flag values) is forwarded unchanged. Arguments that name several
 * owners run one owner at a time and stop at the first failure, because each owner needs
 * its own working directory and its own process. When nothing names an owner the run
 * fails: the root cannot guess a working directory, and answering with a full green suite
 * is what made a mistyped path look like a pass.
