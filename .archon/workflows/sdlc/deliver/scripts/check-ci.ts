/**
 * Classify the current branch PR's check state, once.
 *
 * Archon-owned facts only (gh state, never the project's toolchain). This is the
 * single-shot probe inside the `await-checks` loop_group: the engine's durable
 * `wait:` node owns the time between probes and a concluded check signals it, so this
 * script never sleeps through CI — it reads the state, declares it, and exits.
 *
 * States, declared through this node's `output_format` so `when:` and `until_bash`
 * branch on a certified field rather than on prose:
 *   pending    checks exist and some are still running
 *   concluded  green, no CI configured, or CI gated on a maintainer's approval (fork
 *              or first contribution) — a gate only a maintainer can open, named,
 *              never blocked on and never called green
 *   red        concluded with non-green checks, named. `pass` counts, `skipping` is
 *              accepted as non-blocking, and everything else — `fail`, `cancel`, or
 *              any bucket this script does not recognize — is red. A cancelled check
 *              is not a green check (R4).
 *
 * Red is a report, never a verdict: this probe declares the state and the deliver
 * tail's convergence pass decides what it means — introduced red is correction work,
 * while inherited or environment red pauses for explicit operator action. Nothing here
 * retries: a concluded check does not re-run itself.
 *
 * The one in-process wait: when CI is configured but nothing has started yet,
 * registration gets a single 60 s grace before the maintainer-gated skip is declared.
 * The durable wait around this probe owns the time BETWEEN probes, which is a
 * different problem from a check that has not registered to signal anything yet.

 * neither "this pull request has no checks" from "the read failed", and it says which
