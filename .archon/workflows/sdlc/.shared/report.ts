/**
 * Everything a terminal report owes its reader beyond the result itself.
 *
 * Two sections, both existing because their channel is otherwise write-only: red a
 * green gate deliberately accepted, and discoveries a run recorded outside its own
 * scope. The engine collects neither. The terminal record it assembles is built from
 * the durable event log when a run reaches a terminal status, and is readable only
 * after that, while these sections have to reach the reader from inside the run. So
 * composing them is the pack's, and this module is where all three SDLC tails
 * compose them.
 *
 * Presentation only. Discoveries and caveats never gate readiness, so nothing here
 * may fail a tail that has already done its irreversible work: an unreadable record
 * degrades to a pointer at the file, never to silence and never to a throw. The
 * reader of the report is exactly the person who can go open it.
