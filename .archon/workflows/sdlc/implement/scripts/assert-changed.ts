/**
 * Deterministic guard: does this run have work to show?
 *
 * An AI node that declines its task still exits 0, so without this check the stages
 * after implement would spend money or go public on nothing. It reads Archon-owned
 * facts only -- git state and the run's own recorded artifacts -- never the project's
 * layout or toolchain.
 *
 * Four ways to pass, in order:
 * 1. The working tree changed since the run started (outside `.archon/`).
 * 2. Commits were made since the recorded start SHA.
 * 3. Verified existing work: no new change this run, but the loop declared green AND
 *    the branch already carries commits ahead of the base branch -- a rerun that
 *    verified a fix a prior run committed is progress, not a decline.
 * 4. An honest decline on red the change did not cause: nothing changed, the loop is
 *    not green, and it declared that red `inherited` or `environment` with evidence in
 *    its summary. A correction round can genuinely have nothing left to edit -- the
 *    remaining break is in the base, or in configuration the run has no permission to
 *    change -- and demanding a change anyway asks for an invented one, or throws away
 *    the rounds that already landed. What such a claim is worth is the green gates'
 *    question, not this one; the tolerance lives here only so a change that cannot
 *    exist stops being required.
 *
 * Red the loop introduced still fails with nothing to show, and so does red it left
 * unexplained or unevidenced -- the same bar the green gates hold, because a cause
 * with no failing check named behind it is not a reason. A green claim with neither
 * new work nor a branch lead fails too.
 *
 * Only UNCOMMITTED `.archon/` changes are excluded: Archon copies the operator's
 * workflow edits into every run worktree, so pre-existing uncommitted `.archon/` files
 * predate implement and are not its output. A commit made during the run counts as
 * work even when it only touches `.archon/` -- run-made commits are the run's output
 * (implement legitimately edits workflows).
