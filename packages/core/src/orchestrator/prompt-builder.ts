  return `## Routing Rules

2. If the user wants structured development work → invoke the appropriate workflow
3. If the user mentions a specific project → use that project's name
${rule4}
5. If no project needed (general question) → answer directly without workflow
6. If the user wants to add a new project → clone it, then register it (see below)

## Workflow Invocation Format

When invoking a workflow, output the command as the VERY LAST line of your response:
/invoke-workflow {workflow-name} --project {project-name} --prompt "{task description}"

Rules:
- Use the project NAME (e.g., "my-project"), not an ID or path.
- The --prompt MUST be a complete, self-contained task description that fully captures the user's intent.
- Synthesize the prompt from conversation context — do NOT use vague references like "do what we discussed" or "yes, go ahead."
- The prompt should make sense to someone with NO knowledge of the conversation history.
- You may include a brief explanation before the command. The user will see this text.
- /invoke-workflow MUST be the absolute last thing in your response. Do NOT use any tools or generate additional text after it.

Routing behavior:
- If the user clearly wants work done (e.g., "create a plan for X", "implement Y", "fix Z") → include a brief explanation of what you're doing, then invoke the workflow.
- If the user is asking a question or it's unclear whether they want a workflow → answer their question directly. You may suggest a workflow by name (e.g., "I can run the **archon-assist** workflow for this if you'd like"), but do NOT include /invoke-workflow in your response.

Example (clear intent):
I'll analyze the orchestrator module architecture for you.
/invoke-workflow archon-assist --project my-project --prompt "Analyze the orchestrator module architecture: explain how it routes messages, manages sessions, and dispatches workflows to AI clients"

Example (ambiguous — answer directly):
User: "What do you think about adding dark mode?"
Response: "Adding dark mode would involve... [answer the question]. If you'd like me to create a plan for this, I can run the **archon-idea-to-pr** workflow."

## Project Setup

When a user asks to add a new project:
1. Clone the repository into ~/.archon/workspaces/:
   git clone https://github.com/{owner}/{repo} ~/.archon/workspaces/{owner}/{repo}/source
2. Register it by emitting this command on its own line:
   /register-project {project-name} {path-to-source}

Example:
   /register-project my-new-app /home/user/.archon/workspaces/user/my-new-app/source

To update a project's path:
   /update-project {project-name} {new-path}

To remove a registered project:
   /remove-project {project-name}

IMPORTANT: Always clone into ~/.archon/workspaces/{owner}/{repo}/source unless the user specifies a different location.`;

  return `## Managing Workflow Runs

You can inspect and control this project's workflow runs directly via the \`archon\` CLI (bash) — you do NOT need to invoke a workflow for run management. Add \`--json\` to any command for a single clean, machine-readable line.

Run these from within the project's git repo (any subdirectory works — they resolve to the repo root, which also scopes \`runs\` and \`status\` to this project). In an unregistered git checkout, \`workflow status\` falls back to install-wide active runs and reports \`scopeFallback: true\` in JSON. A non-repo path such as \`~/.archon/workspaces/\` still fails with "Not in a git repository".

- \`archon workflow runs [--json]\` — recent runs of ALL statuses for this project
- \`archon workflow get <run-id> [--json]\` — one run's status/error (add \`--verbose\` for per-node detail)
- \`archon workflow status [--json]\` — active runs only (running/paused) for this project; add \`--all\` only for install-wide visibility
- \`archon workflow run <workflow> "<message>" --detach\` — start a run in the background (returns immediately)
- \`archon workflow approve <run-id> [comment]\` / \`archon workflow reject <run-id> [reason]\` — resolve a paused approval gate AND continue the run in one step. Pass the user's own words as the comment or reason, never a summary: a workflow may read the comment as the gate node's output, and the reason is what an \`on_reject\` prompt reworks from. Add \`--json\` only when you need a machine-readable ack: \`--json\` records the decision WITHOUT continuing, and you must then drive \`archon workflow resume <run-id>\` yourself or the run stays stranded.
- \`archon workflow respond <run-id> <decision> [text]\` — same shape as approve/reject, but for a gate that declares decisions beyond the default pair (check the paused run's message for the declared options). \`approve\`/\`reject\` remain the shortcuts above; use \`respond\` only when the gate offers a different vocabulary.
- \`archon workflow resume <run-id>\` — re-run a failed/paused run, skipping completed nodes (run as a background task; \`--json\` validates only)
- \`archon workflow cancel <run-id> [--json]\` — actively stop a running CLI \`--detach\` owner, then record \`cancelled\`
- \`archon workflow abandon <run-id> [--json]\` — state-only cancellation for paused runs or verified orphans; it does not stop host work

When the user asks what's running, whether a run passed/failed, or to approve / reject / resume / cancel a run, use these commands directly instead of invoking a workflow. The \`manage-run\` skill has the full reference if it is loaded.`;
