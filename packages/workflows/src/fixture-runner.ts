/**
 * Declared-data dry-run fixtures (#2772).
 *
 * A fixture is a `<name>.stubs.yaml` file in a `fixtures/` directory next to a
 * workflow YAML. Reserved top-level keys carry the invocation requirements and
 * the expected outcome, so a fixture runner needs no prose conventions:
 *
 *   fixture:
 *     expect: completed          # or failed / paused / cancelled
 *     fail-node: gate-ready      # required iff expect: failed; a list names the
 *                                # exact failed set (a loop body failure is two
 *                                # entries: the node and its group)
 *     reached: [review__docs]    # nodes that must complete or be stubbed, under any expect
 *     inputs:                    # caller-supplied declared-input values
 *       branch: "task-123"
 *     resolved-text-contains:    # fragments that must appear in a reached node's resolved text
 *       implement: "task-123"
 *   exec-code: false             # execute script/bash nodes instead of stubbing
 *
 * Every remaining key is a node-id → stub-output entry, exactly what
 * `workflow run --dry-run --stubs` accepts. The only execution path is
 * `dryRunWorkflow`, so a fixture can never trigger a real run or provider call.
 *
 * A fixture run reproduces both halves of a real run's source/target split (#2851).
 * SOURCE — named scripts and command files — resolves through one frozen
 * {@link captureWorkflowSource} taken per invocation, the same mechanism `workflow run`
 * uses, so a fixture cannot pass on a workflow whose capture would break the real run.
 * The TARGET that `exec-code: true` nodes execute against is a scratch worktree of the
 * caller repo's HEAD (see {@link withExecWorkspace}), never the operator's tree.
