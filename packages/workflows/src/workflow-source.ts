/**
 * Run-owned capture of a workflow's executable SOURCE.
 *
 * Archon has always had two different directories hiding behind one `cwd`:
 *
 *   - the **source** a workflow, its commands, and its scripts are READ from, and
 *   - the **target** workspace the run ACTS on (provider turns, bash, git, output).
 *
 * Discovery reads the source; everything downstream re-derived it from the target's
 * `cwd`, so a workflow authored in checkout A but executed against worktree B looked
 * for `B/.archon/...` and found nothing. That gap was papered over by copying the
 * whole `.archon` tree into B, which dirtied B's git status, fed B's validators
 * foreign packages, and (because the copy is not scope-aware) carried `.archon/.env`
 * and megabytes of `state/` along with it.
 *
 * This module replaces that copy with a capture the RUN owns: the source directories
 * are frozen once, before the workflow is even selected, and every later lookup
 * resolves against the capture instead of the target. Two consequences matter:
 *
 *   - **The target stays clean.** Nothing is written into B at all.
 *   - **The run stops moving under itself.** Editing or deleting A mid-run cannot
 *     change the graph a paused run resumes into.
 *
 * The capture is the SOLE executable source for its run, not a convenience copy. That
 * is why a capture that cannot be taken, recorded, or verified fails the run instead of
 * degrading to live source: a silent fallback would reintroduce exactly the drift the
 * capture exists to remove. The one exception is a run created before captures existed,
 * which has no record to honor and resumes the way it always did, with a warning.
 *
 * SCOPE: every source scope a static `include:` can reach is captured — project, global
 * (`~/.archon/`), and, in source builds, the on-disk bundled defaults. Freezing only the
 * project scope would leave a hole: a project workflow that includes a global one would
 * still change shape across a resume. Bundled content is selected by the same inventory
 * in source and binary builds, then written into the run's capture so an engine upgrade
 * cannot replace its executable source.
 *
 * Runtime `workflow:` children are deliberately NOT part of the closure. A child is not a
 * run until it starts and freezes its own source — see {@link resolveChildDiscoveryRoot}.
