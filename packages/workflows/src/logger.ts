 * What a node or a whole run spent, in the transcript's own field names.

 * reaches the JSONL row and the DB event together or not at all (#2674). A node that
 * failed after spending reports that spend the same way a node that completed does
 * (#2693).
 *
 * That symmetry holds per SINK, not yet across every node type. A `loop:` node's
 * cumulative totals reach its transcript row on failure and its persisted event on
 * either outcome, but no success exit writes a terminal transcript row for the loop's
 * own id — only per-iteration rows, which carry duration and no usage. `workflow:` and
 * fan-out nodes write no transcript rows at all. So do not read an absent `cost_usd` on
 * a run's transcript as "the whole run was free"; read it per row, where it means the
 * provider reported no cost. Completing that coverage is #2614's audit.
 *
 * Each axis is omitted when nothing was reported for it, so an absent `cost_usd` means
 * the provider reported no cost (Codex reports none at all — #2334) and `0` means it
 * reported zero. Build it with `!== undefined` tests, never truthiness.

 * - **A row is written even when nothing was printed.** Absence of a row would be
 *   ambiguous between "printed nothing" and "not retained"; an absent tail FIELD means
 *   exactly "that stream was empty".
 *
 * This is the evidence copy, never the value channel — `$node.output` keeps its own
